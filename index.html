    <p>
      Crafted Code creates applications with the web.
      <br>
      We build ideas, craft prototypes and polish them
      into products.
    </p>
    <p>
      We care about code, enthuse over experience and dig design.

          <p>
          We performed consultancy for Folksy (a hand crafted goods market
          place) helping them launch a new flatrate payments plan for their
          premium members, rounding out some rough edges in the code base
          and improving the project's test coverage.

          <img alt='screenshot' src='/images/summer_of_cycling.png' />
          <p>
          We worked with challenge for change to produce a prototype "Pledge"
          application with photo sharing and integration with Facebook. All to
          encourage more cycling!

          <p>
          We helped FutureGov to produce a prototype web app to encourage civic
          action in and around Surrey for Surrey County Council.

          We supported Mudlark to develop an app for Channel4's Food Hospital
          show; accessible via the show's microsite, as a Facebook app and 
          with an iOS client.
